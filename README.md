# Kitchen Kanban: A Fable

This talk was first given at Lean Agile Glasgow, on May 11th 2016.

The slides are available in the original Markdown format (hexagonal-ds.md), which can be opened using Deckset. As the theme isn't preserved, I used the "Fir" theme with the red-on-yellow colouring (currently the fourth choice in that theme).

I've included speaker notes, to form a complete story. Obviously, no performance of the talk played out exactly like that.

If you don't have access to Deckset but still want the visuals alongside the notes, I've exported the slides as a PDF.
